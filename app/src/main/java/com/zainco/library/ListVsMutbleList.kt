* List

var language: List<String> = listOf("java", "kotlin", "dart")
List type is an interface which provides read-only access. you are limited to read operations like

get, indexof, subList, contains, size etc

with kotlin you have access to some more functions **like sort, stream,binarySearch

MutableList
Consider this example:

    var mutableLanguage: MutableList<String> = mutableListOf("java", "kotlin", "dart")
with mutablelist you can perform read and write operation i.e., add or remove contents of a list. beside supporting all the functions of interface type List.

add, addAll, replace, replaceAll, set, removeAt etc*/
